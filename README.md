Console Minesweeper

#### Aneesa!
This is a pull request I've raised for you to check. Clone this repository, check my "readme" branch is okay. Add any comments to the code you're not sure about and I can change some things. Let me know if you've got any problems with it. Git is being dead funky with my visual studio and it's not recognising any changes I make to my files so we'll see how this goes.

Also, I hope you know how to play Minesweeper. It'll make understanding this a bit easier. If not check [This Guide Here](https://snapguide.com/guides/play-minesweeper/) and play the one built into Windows for a bit because right now, my version is missing some bits (it still works though!)

Also (again!) I wrote this about a year ago so I've:
1. Got better at programming and architecture
2. Forgotten exactly how this works.

Have fun!
